#As can be seen from the graph, the interpersonal trust and confidence curves of Irish men and swiss women almost overlap in the early period. And as interpersonal trust increases, after about 12, Irish males with the same interpersonal trust scores,they score better than swiss females on Confidence. And later, some of the swiss females scored high on interpersonal confidence, but the confidence scores remained lower than those of equivalent Irish males. Finally there are some swiss females with high interpersonal confidence scores, and at this stage there is very few observed sample of Irish males.

summary(fit<-lm(intp.trust~factor(v238)+v240+v242,df))
# it can seen that the Adjusted R-squared is only 0.04663, it means that the model fits poorly.For the factor(v238)14 which is 0.547 larger than 0.05,is statistically insignificant, which indicates that it is not particularly important in determining intp.trust. In addition to that, all other variables have values less than 0.05, which are significant,which indicates that it is somewhat important in determining intp.trust . Since the linear model normally should be R2=>.7, we should add non-linear relationships to the model, or add the effect of interactions, to improve the value of r2 and thus the performance of the model.
fit$residuals
#it can seen that the residuals are relatively large, so the model's fitting is not well.
#interpret the results：Intercept means answering not live with parents (including in law)'s mean intp.trust, in the case of 0 people in the house, and 0 years of completed education (practically impossible). For those who answered living with their parents, their intp.trust was 0.136 times of those who did not live with their parents. For people who answered live parent(s) in law, their intp.trust was 0.1690863 times of those who did not live with their parents.Also we can see that having more people at home, the higher intp.trust will be. Conversely, intp.trust score will lower if a person complete their education later.

From the graph made by hist(fit$residuals), we can see the residuals are normally distributed. As the shapiro.test can't apply here(too many samples), I will try to use the log transformation to see the linearity.The Adjusted R-squared:  0.04663 is slightly larger than the previous, the linearity of the previous one is not good.

#The distribution of residuals for both males and females is normally distributed, which is consistent with the model assumptions. Another thing is that the variance of the residuals increases with the mean, and an attempt should be made to improve the model.
#The distribution of residuals for females is more skewed in the positive direction（eg: fewer values less than -1, but some values in 2), while the distribution of residuals for males is more normally distributed. Females have slightly better fitness than males in the model.I would have predicted the same thing, because women are more susceptible in terms of intp.trust. For example, different numbers of people in the household could effect women more than man. Therefore, the fitness should be slightly higher under the linear model.
